This was especially annoying because it was only half a year after EVGA's warranty expired. So I researched online and bought an EVGA GTX 1080 Ti (which I can still return). This card is overkill for my setup, I do know that, especially for gaming with 1920x1080. However, I intend to buy a second monitor with either a 2k or 4k resolution which should be enough to keep up with this beast.", "title": "My Computer is broken.",
